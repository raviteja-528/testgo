🔥 **Perfect!** This confirms everything is now working as expected inside your EC2 instance. Here's a quick summary:

---

### ✅ What This Output Means:

```json
{
  "UserId": "AROAXXX:i-0xxxxxxx",
  "Account": "123456789012",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:role/TerraformExecutionRole-us-east-1/i-0xxxxxxx/..."
}
```

* ✅ **STS is working** — EC2 successfully assumed the IAM role using the **regional STS endpoint**.
* ✅ **Your VPC endpoint for STS** is correctly configured and reachable from your private subnet EC2.
* ✅ **No NAT gateway / internet is needed**, since you're using **private VPC endpoints**.
* ✅ **Terraform runner** on this EC2 can now authenticate and download the artifact via the assumed role.

---

### 🟡 What you should do next

Now that this is working **manually**, make it **permanent** so it works automatically for future EC2 instances:

#### 1. Update `UserData` in your `package-template.yaml` or `wrapper-scripts/user_data.sh`:

Append this to set the environment for all users:

```bash
echo 'export AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS=regional' >> /etc/profile.d/aws.sh
echo 'export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1' >> /etc/profile.d/aws.sh
chmod +x /etc/profile.d/aws.sh
```

#### 2. (Optional but safer) Update `send_apply_command.py` in Lambda:

In your Lambda `selectworkerhost` (where `send_apply_command.py` lives), inject the variables inline:

```python
base_command = f"""AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS=regional AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 python3 -m terraform_runner --action=apply \
...
"""
```

Let me know if you'd like help updating your Lambda or packaging again. You're extremely close now — this is the final mile. 🏁

============

fix 2 : 
Yes, you're spot-on — the **`ParameterParser` Lambda** is using a **custom runtime**, which expects a `bootstrap` binary. That’s why the `Handler` is set to:

```yaml
Handler: bootstrap
```

This means AWS will look for an **executable file named `bootstrap`** at the root of the Lambda deployment package.

---

### 🚨 Current Situation:

Right now, your Lambda code has:

* `main.go`
* `go.mod`, `parameter.go`, etc.
* **But missing `bootstrap` binary**

That’s why you’re getting:

> `Error: couldn't find valid bootstrap(s), /var/task/bootstrap, /opt/bootstrap`

---

### ✅ What You Should Do:

#### Option 1: Build Go Code Locally (Recommended for Devs)

If you want to **build the Go files into a proper Lambda binary**, do this on your local (Mac or Linux):

```bash
cd lambda-functions/terraform_open_source_parameter_parser

# Set Go environment for Linux Lambda runtime
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o bootstrap main.go
```

This will create an **executable `bootstrap`** file.

Then:

1. **Zip only the `bootstrap` file**:

   ```bash
   zip function.zip bootstrap
   ```

2. **Upload the zip** to the Lambda console:

   * Go to your Lambda function (`ServiceCatalogTerraformOSParameterParser`)
   * Choose **"Upload from > .zip file"**
   * Select the zip containing only the `bootstrap`

> ✅ You **don’t need to include** `main.go`, `go.mod`, etc. in the Lambda ZIP. Only the **compiled `bootstrap` binary** is required.

---

#### Option 2: Reuse Previously Working Binary

If you already have a working `bootstrap` binary (from Mac or GitHub repo), you can reuse it:

1. Zip it as above
2. Upload it via the Lambda console

---

### 📦 Clean Lambda ZIP Structure:

Your Lambda zip should contain:

```
bootstrap  <-- compiled Go binary (not the .go source files)
```

That’s it. No `main.go`, no `go.mod`, no folders.

---

### ✅ After Upload:

* Test the Lambda manually if needed
* Re-run your Service Catalog product to confirm parameter parsing now works

---

Let me know if you want a full ZIP creation shell script or if you'd like me to double-check your Go build command.
