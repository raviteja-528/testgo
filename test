üî• **Perfect!** This confirms everything is now working as expected inside your EC2 instance. Here's a quick summary:

---

### ‚úÖ What This Output Means:

```json
{
  "UserId": "AROAXXX:i-0xxxxxxx",
  "Account": "123456789012",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:role/TerraformExecutionRole-us-east-1/i-0xxxxxxx/..."
}
```

* ‚úÖ **STS is working** ‚Äî EC2 successfully assumed the IAM role using the **regional STS endpoint**.
* ‚úÖ **Your VPC endpoint for STS** is correctly configured and reachable from your private subnet EC2.
* ‚úÖ **No NAT gateway / internet is needed**, since you're using **private VPC endpoints**.
* ‚úÖ **Terraform runner** on this EC2 can now authenticate and download the artifact via the assumed role.

### üü° What you should do next

Now that this is working **manually**, make it **permanent** so it works automatically for future EC2 instances:

#### 1. Update `UserData` in your `package-template.yaml` or `wrapper-scripts/user_data.sh`:

Append this to set the environment for all users:

```bash
echo 'export AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS=regional' >> /etc/profile.d/aws.sh
echo 'export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1' >> /etc/profile.d/aws.sh
chmod +x /etc/profile.d/aws.sh
```

#### 2. (Optional but safer) Update `send_apply_command.py` in Lambda:

In your Lambda `selectworkerhost` (where `send_apply_command.py` lives), inject the variables inline:

```python
base_command = f"""AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS=regional AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 python3 -m terraform_runner --action=apply \
...
"""
```

Let me know if you'd like help updating your Lambda or packaging again. You're extremely close now ‚Äî this is the final mile. üèÅ
